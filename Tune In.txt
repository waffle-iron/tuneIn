Tune In - Google News For Music

Purpose:
To let users know when their favorite artists come out with new songs

Notes:
User must log in through either Soundcloud or Spotify (both is okay too)

Pull all songs they have liked/artists they follow/playlists they have liked, and get all artists from there
	Note:
		For soundcloud will have to do artists checks - otherwise invalid

Allow user to control % of top artists they would like to follow (top artists - score)
	score factors:
		1. # of songs
		2. # of playlists
		3. Follow or not
	score will get updated once a week <- to account for gradual changes in music taste

Allow user to delete or add an artist at any time
	Note:
		keep it simple, I like the add block way

Keep 1 month worth of notifications in database
	Note:
		one month is just a number

Pages:
1. New Notifications 
2. Old Notifications 
3. Settings
4. Saved Songs

New Notifications Page:
Side bar will have notifications by artists with a number next to it indicating how many new notifications from that artists

Side bar is sorted by timestamp

Main part will have the selected artist’s notifications:
List of songs and provide some sort of ability to play the song through the web app. 
If they like the song it is added into respective Soundcloud or Spotify Library - allow reverse of this
They can also add it to their Saved Songs page - allow reverse of this 

If a user toggles between artists the unopened indication goes away, but artists remain in the sidebar till the session is closed

Once session is closed all opened artist notifications get cleared and pushed into old notifications page
